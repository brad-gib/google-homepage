This was the Google Homepage project for The Odin Project
This was a bit difficult mainly because of the placement of
everything and I wasn't too sure how to do all of it.
I was able to do it all on my own (with a lot of googling)
and only used developer tools once to get the shadow
exactly the same for when the cursor hovers over the
search bar and buttons. This was a challenging project
for me but I learned a lot. It still isn't perfect though,
for some reason the placement was a bit off for the footer
and so I had to fix that by moving it down 10px and to the
left 10px. I had a similar problem with the header. At the
end of it however, it looks quite similar to the actual
Google Homepage so I am happy with what I did on this project.
